# Story 8.1: Task Detail Sheet - Click Outside to Close

## Status: Ready for Review

## Description
When viewing task details in the Sheet component, clicking outside the sheet panel (on the backdrop) should close the sheet. This is standard modal/sheet behavior that users expect.

## Current Behavior
The Sheet component already implements `handleBackdropClick` which calls `onClose()` when clicking the backdrop (line 50-54 of Sheet.tsx). Need to verify this is working correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking the dark backdrop area closes the task detail sheet
- [ ] Clicking inside the sheet panel does NOT close it
- [ ] Escape key still closes the sheet (existing behavior)
- [ ] Close button (X) still works (existing behavior)

## Technical Notes

### Investigation Required
The Sheet.tsx code shows backdrop click handling is implemented:
```tsx
const handleBackdropClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (e.target === e.currentTarget) {
    onClose();
  }
};
```

However, the click handler is on the outer container, and the backdrop is a separate div inside it. The backdrop div doesn't have `pointer-events: none`, so it might be intercepting clicks.

### Likely Fix
Add `pointer-events: none` to the backdrop overlay, so clicks pass through to the parent container which has the `handleBackdropClick` handler.

```tsx
{/* Backdrop */}
<div
  className="absolute animate-fade-in pointer-events-none"
  style={{...}}
/>
```

## Tasks
- [x] Verify current click-outside behavior
- [x] If broken, add `pointer-events-none` to backdrop div
- [ ] Test sheet opens/closes correctly
- [ ] Test escape key still works
- [ ] Test close button still works

## Dev Agent Record

### Fix Applied
Added `pointer-events-none` to the backdrop div in Sheet.tsx. This allows clicks on the backdrop area to pass through to the parent container which has the `handleBackdropClick` handler checking `e.target === e.currentTarget`.

### File List
- `src/components/ui/Sheet.tsx` - Added pointer-events-none to backdrop

## File Changes
- `src/components/ui/Sheet.tsx` - Likely minor fix to pointer-events

## Testing
1. Open a task by clicking on it
2. Click on the dark backdrop area
3. Verify sheet closes
4. Reopen task
5. Click inside the sheet panel
6. Verify sheet stays open
7. Press Escape
8. Verify sheet closes
